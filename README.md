## Server - Flask API

Documentation of the backend API supporting this Sudoku application is available [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8320178/TVemA8kq), as well as in the following write-up.

## I. Setup
To start up the server, follow this sequence of steps:

#### i. Activate the virtualenv and install dependencies for the project

All dependencies for the server can be found in `./server/requirements.txt`. Create a new virtual python environment
and install the dependencies by following the commands below:
```
$ cd server
$ python3 -m virtualenv venv        # create the virtualenv
$ source venv/bin/activate          # activate virtualenv
$ pip install -r requirements.txt   # install all dependencies
```
This should complete without any errors. Nevertheless, some users have reported issues installing
`psycopg2` using pip in Mac OS (this package is the PostgreSQL database adapter for Python).
In the case that this happens, this [page](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42264168)  provides a working solution.

#### ii. Set environmental variables

In order to run the server, you'll need to set a few environmental variables to tell Flask 
 what app to run and which database to use. The following environmental variables can be used for
 development.
```
$ export SECRET_KEY="supersecretkey"       
$ export APP_SETTINGS="server.config.DevelopmentConfig"         # configuration file to use
$ export FLASK_APP="server.py"                                  # where the flask app is launched
$ export FLASK_ENV="development"                                # sets environment to development 
$ export SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI_DEV=<<URI for DB>>             # uri for the db
```

For production settings, add the environmental variables above, but change the following:
```
$ export APP_SETTINGS="server.config.ProductionConfig"
$ export FLASK_ENV="production"
$ export SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI_PROD=<<URI for DB>> 
```

Two Heroku Postgres databases are setup for this project (one for dev and one for testing). Ask Meg for
the URI for these databases if you'd like to use them. You can setup any postgres database locally that you'd 
like though!
 
#### iii. Start the server

Start the flask server using gunicorn and evenlet:
```
$ gunicorn server:app -b localhost:5000 -k eventlet --log-level DEBUG
```
Setting the `log-level` as `DEBUG` is helpful in development, but not strictly necessary. This
will run the server on `localhost:5000`. Eventlet is necessary for providing support
for web-socket transports (default Flask development server only supports long-polling).

## II. Endpoints

#### i. Registration

This API relies on Google Oauth2 tokens for authentication and each request requires that the Oauth2 token be specified
in the request header. For example, in a curl command:
```
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN HERE>
```

To register a new user with their username and password, make a `POST` request to `/register`. For user registration,
the API will ask Google for user information such as their first and last name and email address to store in the
backend database for the user, alongside the unique Google identifier for the person and a custom identifier for
this application. Subsequent requests match the requesting person with their application user based on the unique 
Google identifer.

If successful, the endpoint will return a message like the following:
```
{
    "message": "User Sally Sue was successfully registered"
}
```

To join a puzzle, make a `POST` request to the `/puzzles/<puzzle_id>` endpoint. Upon success, you will see
a message like:

```
{
    'message': "Successfully added Sally Sue (id = 1) to puzzle with id 2."
}
````

#### ii. Puzzles

To get ALL puzzles for a specific user make a `GET` request to `/puzzles`. Note that the user doesn't have to be 
specified; it will be retrieved based on the submitted access token in the header. Here is a sample response:

```
{
    "puzzles": [
        {
            "puzzle_id": 1,
            "completed": false,
            "difficulty": 0.5,
            "point_value": 90,
            "pieces": [ 
                ... // list of puzzle pieces (see example below)
            ],
            "players": [
                {
                    "id": 2,
                    "first_name": "Sally",
                    "last_name": "Sue",
                    "email": "ss201@columbia.edu"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

To see a specific puzzle, make a `GET` request to `/puzzles/<puzzle_id>/`, where `<puzzle_id>` is 
the id of the puzzle in the database. Here is an example response:

```
{
    "puzzle_id": 1,
    "completed": false,
    "difficulty": 0.5,
    "point_value": 90,
    "pieces": [
        {
            "x_coordinate": 0,
            "y_coordinate": 1,
            "static_piece": true,
            "value": 5
        },
        {
            "x_coordinate": 0,
            "y_coordinate": 2,
            "static_piece": true,
            "value": 4
        },
        // ... all other pieces....
    ],
    "players": [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "first_name": "Sally",
            "last_name": "Sue",
            "email": "ss201@columbia.edu"
        }
    ]
}
```

To get the solution to a puzzle and see any discrepancies between the player puzzle and the solution,
make a `GET` request to the `/puzzles/<puzzle_id>/solution` endpoint. If successful, you should see
a response that looks like:

```
{
    "solved_puzzle": {
        "puzzle_id": null,
        "completed": true,
        "difficulty": 0.5,
        "point_value": 90,
        "pieces": [
            {
                "x_coordinate": 0,
                "y_coordinate": 0,
                "static_piece": true,
                "value": 1
            },
            ... other pieces go here....  
        ],
    "discrepancy": [
        {
            "x_coordinate": 0,
            "y_coordinate": 0
        },
            ... all other discrepancies...
.       ]
    }

```

#### iii. Puzzle Pieces

To add a number to the puzzle, make a `POST` request to `/puzzles/<puzzle_id>/piece` (specifying the value 
for `puzzle_id`) with the following request body as JSON:
```
{
    "x_coordinate": 0,
    "y_coordinate": 0,
    "value": 2
}
```
Here is a sample successful response:
```
{
    "message": "Successfully saved the submission of 2 at (0, 0) on puzzle_id 1 by Sally Sue (id = 2)"
}
```

There are a number of possible requests that are invalid; responses to invalid requests
will have a `message` and `reason` field explaining what happened.

To delete a submitted value from the puzzle, make a `DELETE` request to `/puzzles/<puzzle_id>/piece` 
(specifying the value for `puzzle_id`) with the following request body as JSON:

```
{
    "x_coordinate": 0,
    "y_coordinate": 1
}
```
Here is a sample successful response:
```
{
    "message": "Successfully deleted piece at position (0, 1) on puzzle_id 1."
}
```

## III. Tests/Checks

When running the scripts outlined below, all test/coverage/style check results will be written to a file in 
`./reports/backend` under the corresponding folder.

### i. Unit Tests

To run unit tests:
```
$ (venv) ./bin/run_backend_tests.sh unit
```

### ii. Integration Tests

To run the integration test suite for the api, make sure to set the following
environmental variables: `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI_TEST`, `FLASK_APP`, `FLASK_ENV`. 

If you forget to set the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI_TEST` correctly, you'll see this error message: 
`AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'drivername'`.

To run the tests:
```
$ (venv) ./bin/run_backend_tests.sh integration
```

To run both integration and unit tests at the same type, simply omit the specification of integration and unit:
```
$ (venv) ./bin/run_backend_tests.sh
```

### iii. Test Coverage

This project uses python's coverage tool to check test coverage. To run coverage:
```
$ (venv) ./bin/run_backend_coverage.sh <TEST-TYPE>
```
Where `<TEST-TYPE>` can be `unit`, `integration` or not specified (in this case it will run both test types) and 
determine coverage based on both.

### iv. Bug/Style Checker

This project uses pylint for style checking and bug finding. To run pylint:

```
$ (venv) ./bin/run_backend_bugs_style_check.sh 
```

### v. Manual Tests

The easiest way to manually the API is through Postman. You can easily generate an oauth2 token for testing
by going to Google's Oauth 2.0 Playground [here](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/).

Make sure that in the first step, you authorize the following two APIs found under `Google Oauth2 API v2`:
```
* https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
* https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile
```
Once you clicked on "Authorize APIs" (you may also need to sign into Google) and have exchanged the authorization
code for tokens, the access token field should automatically populate. You can use this access token for any requests 
made in Postman until the token expires.
